# Rust + WebAssembly = ðŸ’–

This repository is a simple, organic means of coordinating work on using Rust
and WebAssembly together.

# Get Involved!

Get involved with the Rust and WebAssembly community in just **three easy
steps!**

## 1. Join our Chat

Chat with the Rust and WebAssembly community in [the `#wg-wasm` channel of
the Rust project's Discord server][discord].

Say "hello" and introduce yourself!

## 2. Do some Rust and WebAssembly Yourself

Read our short [Rust and WebAssembly book][book], complete its [tutorial][], and
compile some Rust into WebAssembly. If you run into a paper cut or roadblock,
[let us know by filing an issue!][file-issue-book]

## 3. Join the Rust and WebAssembly Working Group

We are building a Rust and WebAssembly future where:

* The Web is the primary target.
* Rust plays nice with JavaScript, and can surgically replace a
  performance-sensitive JavaScript module or function without throwing away the
  existing code base.

We are not focusing on (but still encourage others to experiment with) scenarios
where:

* The Web is not the primary target (e.g. WebAssembly as a universal binary
  format, or an operating system that runs WebAssembly processes instead of
  native code).
* A Web application is written in pure Rust, without integrating with any
  JavaScript.

We meet on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) every week to track progress, give status
updates, and discuss issues. We coordinate meetings with [issues labeled
"meeting" in the `rustwasm/team` repository][meetings].

First get your feet wet by tackling one of these issues:

* [Issues labeled "good first issue" in the `rustwasm/*` repositories][good-first-issue]

* [Issues labeled "help wanted" in the `rustwasm/*` repositories.][help-wanted]

Then help us make progress on the working group goals. To learn more about or
contribute towards a particular goal, read its `goals/*.md` page and its "How to
Help" section. If you have any questions about a goal, contact its owner.
